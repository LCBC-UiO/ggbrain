This package mainly contains a plotting function `ggseg` and data.frames of different brain atlases for plotting.
Plotting results of analyses on regions or networks often involves swapping between statistical tools, like R, and software for brain imaging to correctly visualise analysis results.

This package aims to make it possible to plot results directly through R. 

## Atlases
There are currently four atlases available in the package:  

1. `dk` - Desikan-Killany atlas (aparc).   
2. `aseg` - Automatic subcortical segmentation.  

We are working on creating a detailed description in the wiki on how to create and contribute atlases to the package.
The `ggseg` function already allows you to provide it with a data.frame of a custom atlas if you have it, but is must
correspond to certain specifications to work.

**Note:** As of version 1.5.3, `ggseg` was split into two packages: one for 2d polygon plots in ggplot, and another for 3d mesh plots through plotly. 
This was done to reduce package size, dependencies, and also to simplify maintenance. 
If you want the 3d plotting tool, please go the [ggseg3d repository](https://github.com/LCBC-UiO/ggseg3d).

Please see the [wiki](https://github.com/LCBC-UiO/ggsegExtra/wiki/Contributing%3A-polygon-atlases-new) for information on adding atlases, or inspect the included datasets for requirements. 
If anything is unclear in the wiki, give us a shout out in the issues!

You may find more atlases in the companion package [ggsegExtra](https://github.com/LCBC-UiO/ggsegExtra).

## Installation
The package can be installed using devtools. The package includes some large datasets for the brain coordinates. Please be patient during download and install, it will take some time.

```{r eval=F}
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("LCBC-UiO/ggseg", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

The functions are now installed, and you may load them when you want to use them.
All functions are documented in standard R fashion.

## Use
```{r, out.width='50%'}
library(ggseg)
ggseg(atlas=dk)
ggseg(atlas=aseg)
```

The package also has several vignettes, to help you get started using it. 
You can access it [here](https://lcbc-uio.github.io/ggseg/), or via R:

```{r eval=F}
vignette("ggseg")
```

You can also see one of the creators blog for introductions to its use [here](https://drmowinckels.io/blog/introducing-the-ggseg-r-package-for-brain-segmentations/)


### Report bugs or requests  
Don't hesitate to ask for support using [github issues](https://github.com/LCBC-UiO/ggseg/issues), or requesting new atlases. 
While we would love getting help in creating new atlases, you may also request atlases through the issues, and we will try to get to it.
